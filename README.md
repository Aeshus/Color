# Color | Rust PNG Pretty-Printer
### (Not Finished)
This is a small little project for me to learn more rust!
This impliments a very basic PNG parser and prints it to STDOUT in a more readable form!
It's currently implimentation should theoretically work fine, but I'm constantly changing plans and rewriting older portions.


## Why?
This is a simple little project for me building on top of what I've learned over my year of schooling.
The project itself is a rewrite of my final project, and is still in (somewhat) active development.
Hopefully I will have this finished in the next few weeks!
